# BookedUp Summry

**By Jinghan Xu and Sol Lee**

## Topic: Factors affecting hotel room booking status

## Background
For our  project, we use the [Hotel Reservations Classification Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/hotel-reservations-classification-dataset) to
explore which factors, such as room type, room price, number of guests, affect hotel room booking status
and predict customer’s likelihood to cancel by using a machine learning model. Our target variable is
“Booking status”, which is binary with values “Canceled” vs. “Not canceled”.

## Project Sections:
We break the project down into the following components:
1. Introduction: Briefly describe the dataset and the variables
2. Data Exploration/Visualization: see the correlation among variables
3. Variable selection:
- Findings from Data Exploration
- Lasso Regression
4. Modeling
- Decision tree
- Logistic/Linear Regression (Ridge)
5. Conclusion
6. Limitations/Areas for further research
